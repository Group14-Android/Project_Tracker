## Top 3 App Ideas
1. Project Tracker App
2. Ideal Roommate
3. Number 3
## 3 App Evaluations
1. **Project Tracker App** 
    - **Descriptiona:** Empower users to track project progress, resources, photos, and milestones in one app. Users can reference these projects for future work, resume building, or personal achivement tracking.
    - **Category:** Productivity
    - **Mobile:** Mobile allows for fast entry, . Camera is used to upload photos.
    - **Story:** Allows users to track their project, see past work, and quickly access resources used. Users can link things as they see fit, enabling flexibility needed when working on one off projects. If a similar project is worked on six months later, the old one can be used to quickly find links and notes.
    - **Market:** Workers working on ad hoc projects without defined structure. Students working on school work, or personal projects. New project managers who have yet to define their preferred style.
    - **Habit:** Users can use this at work, school, or for personal project needs.
    - **Scope:** Users should be able to title projects, provide description, and input tasks. This will link to a list of notes, a list of resources, and photos. Users should be able to add projects, tag them, add notes, add resources, and photos.
