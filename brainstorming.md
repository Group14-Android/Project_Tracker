## Top 3 App Ideas
1. Project Tracker App

3. Number 3
## 3 App Evaluations
1. **Project Tracker App** 
    - **Descriptiona:** Empower users to track project progress, resources, photos, and milestones in one app. Users can reference these projects for future work, resume building, or personal achivement tracking.
    - **Category:** Productivity
    - **Mobile:** Mobile allows for fast entry, . Camera is used to upload photos.
    - **Story:** Allows users to track their project, see past work, and quickly access resources used. Users can link things as they see fit, enabling flexibility needed when working on one off projects. If a similar project is worked on six months later, the old one can be used to quickly find links and notes.
    - **Market:** Workers working on ad hoc projects without defined structure. Students working on school work, or personal projects. New project managers who have yet to define their preferred style.
    - **Habit:** Users can use this at work, school, or for personal project needs.
    - **Scope:** Users should be able to title projects, provide description, and input tasks. This will link to a list of notes, a list of resources, and photos. Users should be able to add projects, tag them, add notes, add resources, and photos. 
2. **Ideal Roommate**
    - **Description:** Allows to effectively communicate with their roommates on many different issues such as common expenses, chores and quiet time notification. In addition it provides records to solve any disagreements
    - **Category:** Communication
    - **Mobile:** Users can upload expenses, chores and quiet time segment on the app, while immediately receiving notifications about their roommates uploads.
    - **Story:** Allows user to communicate in a friendly way about their everyday tasks. Roommates can use the expenses tab to post shared products payed by one person. They can also use the quiet mode to send their roommates notification about a time when they need quiet time (like taking an online exam). A TODO chores tab allows user to effectively communicate about house chores.
    - **Market:** This app could be used by all people co-leasing a property, however the biggest market would be students as students primarily have roommates while in college.
    - **Habit:** Users can use this in their house if they have roommates.
    - **Scope:** Users should be able to post expenses for common pruduct/ utilities. They also use the app to communicate about household chores they have to do, as well as use the quiet mode to notify their roommates of the times they need some quiet time(like online exams).
3. **Job/Internship Tracker**
    - **Description:** User can use this app to keep track of their progress in their job/internship hunt. Users can enter new applications, upcoming assessments/interviews and implement notifications so that deadlines are not missed. The app can also create graphs of thier current progress.
    - **Category:** Productivity
    - **Mobile:** Users can store their applications and their progress. They can receive notifications so that no deadline is missed.
    - **Story:** Allows user to effectively store their job/internships applications with all relevant data such as application link, company careers websits, date submiited and any other relevant notes. The user then can update the status and add assessment/interview deadlines that appear on a different tab based on their deadline.
    - **Market:** This app could be used by everyone looking for new opportunities, however students seeking internships or new grad roles will be the primary market.
    - **Habit:** Users can use tha app to track their job/internship applications.
    - **Scope:** Users can use this app to effectively organize their job/internshipd hunt. Details about the company and application can be stored so that the user can prepare better for the interview by using the stored data. Notifications about assessments/interviews will help the user stay on top of the application process.Finally the app has a progress tab which graphically represents the user's progress.
